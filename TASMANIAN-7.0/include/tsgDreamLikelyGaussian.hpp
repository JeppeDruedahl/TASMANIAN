//! \par Gaussian Likelihood
//! The general formula for Gaussian likelihood is \f$ L(y | d_1 \cdots d_n) = \exp\left( 0.5 sum_{i=1}^n (y - d_i)^T \Sigma^{-1} (y - d_i) \right)\f$
//! where the \f$ d_i \f$ are the data observations, \b y is the model output, and \f$ \Sigma \f$ is the noise covariance matrix.
//!
//! \par Isotropic Gaussian
//! The simplest isotopic case of Gaussian likelihood assumes that the covariance matrix is scaled identity,
//! i.e., the noise has no correlation and has the same magnitude for each model output,
//! then inverting the covariance matrix reduces to multiplying by the inverse of the noise variance (magnitude).
//! Also, the sum corresponding to the multiple data samples can be replaced by scaled operation on the data mean (average).
