 * \par Adaptive Refinement
 * The most efficient sparse grids approximation strategies are adaptive,
 * i.e., the grid is constructed to best capture the behavior of the specific
 * target model. Adapting a grid requires analysis of the existing loaded
 * model values followed by a decision on how to best expand the grid.
 * Sometimes the complexity of the refinement algorithms requires additional
 * data storage and methods implemented outside of the main grid classes.
