 * \brief Rule with hard-corded tabulated points and weights.
 *
 * The Gauss-Patterson rule combines nested points with the optimality of the Gauss quadratures.
 * While not as powerful as Gauss-Legendre in one and tow dimensions, the rule wins in
 * polynomial space of exactness with respect to integration for 3 or more dimensions.
 * However, the points and weights are very hard to compute and most algorithms are very
 * ill-conditioned. Thus, it is beneficial to have the points for the first 9 levels hard-coded.
 *
 * Note that Gauss-Legendre rule combined with a full tensor grid gives highest exactness per
 * number of points with respect to integration in one and two dimensions.
